  <h2>The Online Coronavirus Combat Supply Store (OCCSS) was created with the purpose to provide customers with essential supplies not easily acquired during the COVID-19 outbreak. Mass panic among consumers has boosted demand beyond what local supply chains can handle, and has resulted in food and supply shortages. Our store was founded under the belief that all people should have access to everyday essentials at an affordable price, with no price gouging. As such, OCCSS strives to provide essentials such as: face masks, fresh and non-perishable grocery items, first aid supplies, over-the-counter medicine, toiletries, gloves, toilet paper, disinfecting supplies and more.</h2> 
  <br>
  <h3>Our webstore is a hub that will facilitate the acquisition of such essentials, and the subsequent scope will serve as a foundation for OCCSS moving forward.</h3></section>
